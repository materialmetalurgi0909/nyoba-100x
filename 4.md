1. What is the difference between git reset and git revert. When would you use one over the other?
 -git revert = This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit. This command adds new history to the project (it doesn't modify existing history).
 -git reset = This command is a little more complicated. It actually does a couple of different things depending on how it is invoked. It modifies the index (the so-called "staging area"). Or it changes which commit a branch head is currently pointing at. This command may alter existing history (by changing the commit that a branch references).
 -we use git revert If a commit has been made somewhere in the project's history, and you later decide that the commit is wrong and should not have been done, then git revert is the tool for the job.
 -we use git reset If you have made a commit, but haven't shared it with anyone else and you decide you don't want it, then you can use git reset to rewrite the history so that it looks as though you never made that commit.

2. What is the difference between git merge and git rebase. When would you use one over the other?
 -Git rebase and merge both integrate changes from one branch into another. Where they differ is how it's done. Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master. Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history.
 -If you're working alone or on a small team, use rebase. If you're working with a big team, use merge.

3. What is the difference between git stash pop and git stash apply. When would you use one over the other?
 -git stash pop throws away the stash after applying it, whereas git stash apply leaves it in the stash list for possible later reuse.
 -we use git stash pop when we want to remove a single stashed state from the stash list and apply it on top of the current working tree state,
 -we use git stash apply is just like git stash pop but when we do not want to remove the state from the stash list, we use git stash apply.

4. What kinds of things can you do in interactive mode when rebasing?
 Interactive rebasing can be used for changing commits in many ways such as editing, deleting, and squashing
